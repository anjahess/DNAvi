DNAvi is a Python-based tool for rapid analysis and visualization of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragment size profiles directly from electrophoresis data, without the need for sequencing. It enables normalization, statistical comparison, and publication-ready plotting of multiple samples, supporting quality control and exploratory fragmentomics in clinical and research workflows.
